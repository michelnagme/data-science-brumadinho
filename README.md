# Analysis of the possible impact of rainfall in Brumadinho's Dam collapse

This repository contains the data, code and analysis of the possibility of rainfalls being a cause the one of the greatest natural disasters in history. The code is part of notebooks, which also bring the analysis and conclusions. There's also a story posted in Medium with a summary of the questions and findings which can be found [here](https://medium.com/@michelfnrc/they-want-us-to-believe-heavy-rain-is-one-of-the-causes-of-brumadinhos-dam-collapse-should-we-39386a7f6ee1).

## Notebooks' installation and usage

If you want to run any of the notebooks locally, first you need to [install Jupyter platform](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) in your device. After that, launching a notebook should be as easy as running the following command

  `$ jupyter notebook`

After installing Jupyter, the only library you'll probably need to install by yourself is `mplleaflet`, what you can do from PyPI using 

  `$ pip install mplleaflet`

A technically deeper approach is available at the notebooks.
