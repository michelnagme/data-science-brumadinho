## Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

The motivation for this project is to evaluate the impact of rainfall in the collapse of Dam I in Brumadinho, MG, Brazil. For that, we've answered the following questions:

1. Was there more rain than usual in late 2018?
2. Has rainfall increased in the years that followed 2016?
3. Were there unexpected rain patterns that could have impacted the rupture of Brumadinhoâ€™s dam?

## Files descriptions <a name="files"></a>

* There are 2 notebooks available, both with same content but one in English and another in Portuguese. They contain all analysis done to answer the questions above, with a step-by-step guide.
* Since data were collected from external sources, a copy of the full set of files used for this project is available at `/data` folder.
* The `/docs` folder contains a HTML version of the english notebook, which is available online at https://michelnagme.github.io/data-science-brumadinho/

## Notebooks' installation and usage <a name="installation"></a>

If you want to run any of the notebooks locally, first you need to [install Jupyter platform](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) in your device.

After installing Jupyter, the only library you'll probably need to install by yourself is `mplleaflet`, what you can do from PyPI using 

> `$ pip install mplleaflet`
  
Lastly, launching a notebook should be as easy as running the following command

> `$ jupyter notebook`

## Results <a name="results"></a>

A story posted in Medium with a summary of the questions, analysis and findings can be found [here](https://medium.com/@michelfnrc/they-want-us-to-believe-heavy-rain-is-one-of-the-causes-of-brumadinhos-dam-collapse-should-we-39386a7f6ee1). A technically deeper approach is available at the notebooks.
